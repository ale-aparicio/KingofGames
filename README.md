# King of Games

King of Games is a one stop webpage for all YuGiOh players to stay up to date with the latest products, news, and 
information. The reason for the creation of this project is due to a lack of accesibled user-friendly web pages
for YuGiOh. 

For my first Mile Stone Project I decided to draw inspiration from a hobby of mine. As a player myself 
I listed some features other pages where missing or were made to acess.

# Project Aim
## User Goals

* To encourage new players to learn the proper way of playing YuGiOh aswell as to make all the information they
need or might need easily accesible.

* All players to have a more accesible way of acquiring essential information about the 
game such as Rules, News, and New Products

* Make an easy to use web page so that all players all able to utilize it to its full capacity.

# User Feedback

1. As a new player and as someone who is not very good with technology I found the page very easy to use
and found all the information I needed to know aobut the game. I personally found the Card of the Day to be
a creative feature to interact and teach new players about the different cards.

2. I've been playing YuGiOh for almost 10 years now and I found myself visiting and recommending King of Games
to many of my friends aswell as to new players whenever we needed information for upcoming products.

3. I am a game shop owner and I have found this site higly useful. After telling my customers about the page 
I find myself no longer answering tedious questions like when is a proudct coming  out or when are events taking place.

# Design Process

* The main structure of the project started with the Home, About, Products, and How to Play pages as these 
were the fundamental pages I wanted to structure my webpage. I was also conflicted on the main logo for the header. 
The reason why it does not have the King of Games name and instead there is the iconic YuGiOh logo is so that 
new players can familiarize themselves with the brand and we decided we didn't want to take credit for any of the 
core items but instead pay homage to a game we respect and care for deeply. 

* Once I knew the main ideas were in place I went through a trial and error process using [Figma](figma.com). The early process
started with picking the righ color scheme that would set the tone and give character to my webpage. In the end I decided
to use base my color scheme on the famous YuGiOh logo using a dark brown/grey (#272727) for all my backgrounds and use a 
bright red (AD261D) to accent the headers and content aswell as a light grey (C4C4C4) as a light border used in the desktop
view of the page to add layering into my structure and not have it seem so bland and generic and for text content a nice grey background (616161)
was added to accent the text and make it more appealing to the viewer.

* I decided to make a template I had to follow for consistency and easy navigation throughout the page 
the main structure is as follows: using the light grey (C4C4C4) as a primary border then adding the darkbrown/grey (272727)
as a padding and on top a nice red background where the content can be higlighted and add character and energy to the page with 
a bright red (AD261D).
